# Getting Started with Create React App

# React Todo App – Components & State

This project is a simple Todo List application built using React to understand the concepts of components and state. The application allows users to add a todo, delete a todo, and mark a todo as completed.

The React project is located inside the folder `react todo-app/todo-app`. All commands must be executed inside this folder because it contains the `package.json` file.

To run this project, first make sure Node.js and npm are installed on your system. Open the folder `react todo-app/todo-app` in VS Code, then open the terminal from the menu (Terminal → New Terminal). If the terminal is not already inside the project folder, navigate to it using the following command: `cd "C:\Users\Rohann\Downloads\project\react todo-app\todo-app"`. After that, install the required dependencies by running `npm install` (this is required only the first time). Once the installation is complete, start the application by running `npm start`.

After running the project, open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the Todo App.

The main commands used in this project are `npm install` to install all required packages and `npm start` to run the React application. The main features of this application include adding todos, deleting todos, marking todos as completed, using React functional components, and managing application data using the `useState` hook. Always make sure to run the commands in the folder that contains the `package.json` file, otherwise the project will not run.
